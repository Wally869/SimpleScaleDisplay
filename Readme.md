## SimpleScalesDisplay

Small helper webapp to check notes and alterations belonging to a given scale.  


## To Do  
- Create the scale displays  
Thought to use wikipedia files, but was offline (also, I think might be markdown and not actual images?)
Use lilypond, or abc (add support for lilypond or abc in MusiStrata)
- Create audio sample  
use lossy format (mp3?)
